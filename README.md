Aquascope is a tool that generates interactive visualizations of Rust programs. These visualizations show how Rust's borrow checker "thinks" about a program, and how a Rust program actually executes. Here is a sample output of Aquascope:

## Installation

We provide an [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) preprocessor that embeds Aquascope diagrams into an mdBook. To use it, you need to install the `mdbook-aquascope` and `cargo-aquascope` binaries as follows.

```sh
cargo install mdbook-aquascope --locked --version 0.3.4
rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src rustc-dev llvm-tools-preview miri
cargo +nightly-2023-08-25 install aquascope_front --git https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope --tag v0.3.4 --locked
cargo +nightly-2023-08-25 miri setup
```

Note that `cargo-aquascope` is installed via `aquascope_front` and must be installed via git and with a specific nightly toolchain. The `miri setup` command is a necessary prerequisite to running the Aquascope interpreter.

### From Source

If you want to install from source, you first need to install [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make), a Rust build tool, like this:

```
cargo install cargo-make --locked
```

Then you need to install [Depot](https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/depot/), a Javascript build tool, like this:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/depot/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Then you can install Aquascope from source like this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope.git
cd aquascope
cargo make install-mdbook
```

## Usage

First, enable `mdbook-aquascope` in your mdBook's `book.toml` like so:

```toml
# book.toml
[preprocessor.aquascope]
```

Then add an Aquascope code block to one of your Markdown source files like this:

    ```aquascope,interpreter
    #fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello ");`[]`
    s.push_str("world");`[]`
    #}
    ```

Further documentation on the syntax and configuration of Aquascope blocks will be provided once the interface is more stable.
